# Torqlang

## A fantastically simple approach to concurrent programming.

### Why? 

Mainstream programming languages require explicit control structures, resulting in unnatural, complex, and tangled programs.

### How?

Torqlang solves this problem with a patent-pending programming model called Actorflow, which fuses message-passing concurrency with declarative dataflow, giving us a naturally sequential style void of unnecessary complexity.

### Where?
